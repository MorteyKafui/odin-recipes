    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken pieces are coated with a richly seasoned herb and spice rub, baked
      with pineapple slices, and served over pineapple jasmine rice.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Jasmine rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain pineapple; reserve 1 tablespoon juice. Chop 2 pineapple slices;
        set aside for rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together reserved juice, garlic powder, thyme, nutmeg, allspice,
        salt and cinnamon in small bowl, until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange chicken on foil-lined sheet pan. Season with salt and pepper.
        Rub each breast half with spice mixture over and under the skin. Place
        two pineapple slices on each breast. Bake at 350 degrees F 30 to 40
        minutes, or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165 degrees F
        and is no longer pink in center (Note: if using chicken legs, time will
        need to be increased 15 to 25 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook olive oil, red onion and red pepper over medium-high heat in medium
        saucepan about 5 minutes or until onions are tender. Add rice and
        chopped pineapple to sauce pan, cook 3 minutes more. Add chicken broth,
        heat to boiling. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 15 minutes or until
        all liquid is absorbed. Add chopped basil; let stand 5 minutes before
        serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange rice and chicken on 4 plates for service. Garnish with
        additional chopped basil, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
