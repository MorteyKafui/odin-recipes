    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A tasty, easy-to-make chicken dish -- my husband loves it. Sometimes I cut
      the chicken in strips,and serve over pasta.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the balsamic vinegar, chicken broth, sugar, garlic, and
        Italian seasoning in a bowl, place the chicken breasts in the marinade,
        and marinate for 10 minutes on each side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the
        chicken from the marinade and reserve the marinade. Place the chicken in
        the heated pan and cook until they start to brown and are no longer pink
        inside, about 7 minutes per side. Pour the marinade into the skillet,
        and cook until it thickens slightly, turning the chicken breasts over
        once or twice, about 5 minutes.
