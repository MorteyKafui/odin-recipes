    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds raw pork belly</li>

      <li>hickory or apple wood chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a 2 gallon container, mix together the brown sugar, curing mixture,
        and water. Submerge the pork belly in the mixture so that it is covered
        completely. If the meat floats, you can weigh it down with a dinner
        plate or similar object. Refrigerate covered for six days.
      </li>
      <li>
        Light charcoal in an outdoor smoker. Soak wood chips in a bowl of water.
        When the temperature of the smoker is between 140 and 150 degrees coals
        are ready. Smoke the pork belly for 6 hours, throwing a handful of wood
        chips on the coals about once an hour. Store in the refrigerator. Slice
        and fry as you would with store-bought bacon.
